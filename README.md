# 3D-Mandelbrot-Project
This project builds off of the algorithms generated by Paul Nylander and Daniel White in 2009 that depicts a 3D rendition of the famous mandelbrot fractal using spherical coordinates, and uses raytracing with OpenGL to render the window. We've attempted at Julia sets and a quaternion version, but they are still in their experimental stages. Current features include relative camera rotations as well as panning, zooming, arcball rotations, change in power, "phi" and "theta" phase shifts, changing the raytrace step size and maximum iteration count, shading, and the usage of a singular point light as well as changing its movement and intensity. There is a multisampling option, but currently that feature is buggy and does not provide desirable results.
